# phrack2epub

This simple python 2 script downloads issues (1 or more or all) and saves them in epub format

You should be able to then read them on your favourite ereader, though YMMV. At least FBReader seems to work well (no affiliation, just a fan!)

## Installation
Simply install required imports via pip (or similar), probably in a virtualenv

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Generation
Simply run

$ python phrack.py [first-issue-number] [last-issue-number]

All the epubs will be generated in the script directory
